# Unicorn_attractor
## Overview

This website was set up to that allows registered users to request bug fixes and feature updates to our existing software. We
make money from it by the users paying for extra features, but also helps us remove bugs from our software by having an on-line
community. Bugs and features are prioritised based on the number of votes each has. As bugs are free, users are only allowed to 
vote for each bug once. The bug with the most votes will be worked on. Features on the other hand the user can vote many times 
for each feature, as the user is paying a set fee for each vote. The features with the most votes (or made the most money) will
be worked on first. The company will split its time between working on features and bugs evenly. 

## UX

### What is this website for?
This website was created to create revenue through adding extra features, and also help to identify bugs on our existing software and
and allows us to prioritise the bugs causing the most issues with our customers.
The benfit for the customer is they also get a better product due to reduced bugs in the software, but can also get extra 
features added.

In the design of this web page I decided to use Balsamiq to create my wire frames. I did two sets of screens one for mobile and the other for desktop. For mobile I only did screen that were significantly different from large screens. Both can be seen under assets\wire frames folder
within the project.
